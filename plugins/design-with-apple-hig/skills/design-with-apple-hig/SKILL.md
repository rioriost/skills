# Apple HIG Design Skill

Direct Apple-platform design work from current primary evidence. Use third-party skills as bounded specialists, never as the authority. Preserve the difference between Apple-native alignment and Apple-inspired design on other platforms.

## Run the evidence-first workflow

1. Classify the task as `explain`, `design`, `build`, `review`, `score`, `refactor`, or `audit`.
2. Identify target platform and OS range, framework, artifact, input methods, requested depth, and testable states. Infer clear facts; ask only when the answer changes navigation, input, or implementation architecture.
3. Read [source-routing.md](references/source-routing.md) and apply [freshness.md](references/freshness.md) to distinguish current public releases, prereleases, deployment targets, and tested runtimes. Build the smallest evidence bundle that can decide the task.
4. Read the relevant section of [official-source-map.md](references/official-source-map.md). Retrieve current Apple pages for every material, exact, version-specific, or normative claim. Use `scripts/fetch_apple_hig.py` when the HTML page is JavaScript-only.
5. Read only the applicable platform section in [platform-routing.md](references/platform-routing.md). Do not flatten platform differences.
6. Form a concise design contract: purpose, hierarchy, navigation, primary action, input, density, adaptation, appearance, accessibility, motion, privacy, localization, and recovery.
7. For design or implementation reviews, use the matching mode in [codex-workflows.md](references/codex-workflows.md). Design, implement, or review. Prefer system behavior and semantics over visual imitation.
8. For formal review or scoring, read [review-rubric.md](references/review-rubric.md). Lead with observable task and safety issues.
9. For code changes or runnable UI, execute [verification-loop.md](references/verification-loop.md). Re-test failed and high-severity paths after changes. For substantial work, use [review-record-template.md](references/review-record-template.md) to track sources, stable finding IDs, and pass/fail/blocked/not-run/not-applicable checks.

Use [regression-scenarios.md](references/regression-scenarios.md) when changing or evaluating this skill. Read [bibliography.md](references/bibliography.md) only when updating this skill, evaluating a third-party source, explaining provenance, or auditing source quality.

## Preserve source meaning

Keep Apple guidance at its original strength:

- Treat `required`, `must`, API availability, safety constraints, and platform-enforced behavior as requirements only when the current primary source supports that strength.
- Preserve `prefer`, `consider`, `generally`, `if`, and `avoid` as conditional guidance. Do not rewrite them as `always` or `never`.
- Treat measurements with their component, platform, input, and OS scope. A general target is not automatically a release-blocking minimum everywhere.
- Treat the HIG as design guidance, SDK documentation as implementation fact, App Review Guidelines as distribution policy, and WCAG or another standard as a separate normative source.
- When Apple gives a principle without a number, do not invent a grid, breakpoint, page count, timing, score, or threshold.

Resolve conflicts within the claim’s domain: HIG for design guidance, SDK documentation for API contracts, and policy for distribution. An observed runtime result is evidence for that configuration, not a replacement API contract. Match platform, OS, component, and conditions before comparing sources; preserve unresolved conflicts and dates.

## Label material claims

Use these labels in formal reviews and evidence ledgers:

- `APPLE-HIG`: current Apple HIG or Apple Design guidance.
- `APPLE-SDK`: documented Apple API requirements, availability, and contracts. Label observed runtime behavior separately as `OBSERVATION`.
- `APPLE-POLICY`: current App Review Guidelines or Apple program/distribution rules; keep section and applicability separate from HIG guidance.
- `APPLE-RESOURCE`: official design kit, template, symbol, or asset guidance.
- `ACCESSIBILITY`: an applicable accessibility standard, API, or assistive-technology test.
- `OBSERVATION`: visible or reproducible in the supplied artifact.
- `AUDIT`: a static or automated tool signal requiring confirmation.
- `HEURISTIC`: a reasoned recommendation that is not an Apple requirement.

For `APPLE-*` and `ACCESSIBILITY` findings, retain the page URL and retrieval date. For exact values, retain units, default/minimum distinctions, surrounding scope, exceptions, and section. Missing evidence is `unverified`, not an inferred requirement. Strength and severity are independent: a strong modal alone does not establish user impact.

## Route specialist skills narrowly

Use another installed skill only when it materially contributes. Read its `SKILL.md` first and follow host announcement rules.

- Use frontend-design or a site-building skill to implement substantial Web UI; keep this skill responsible for Apple-versus-Web boundaries and evidence.
- Use browser, Chrome, computer-use, or Playwright skills to inspect screenshots, responsive states, focus, keyboard operation, and live behavior.
- Use repository-native build, preview, test, snapshot, and accessibility tooling for Apple implementations.
- Use HIG Doctor for code-detectable candidates only. Classify every result and never equate a clean scan with HIG compliance.
- Use a distilled HIG corpus only for topic discovery. Re-fetch Apple primary sources before adopting its values or wording.
- Use motion-specialist guidance for direct manipulation, continuity, and implementation ideas; label transferred values and Web physics as heuristics unless Apple currently specifies them.

Do not load every specialist or a full HIG corpus. A normal bundle is one platform overview, one to four relevant HIG topics, one framework/API page, and one applicable accessibility page. Add current Design/WWDC updates for new OS, beta, Liquid Glass, or changed-component work.

## Preserve platform boundaries

- Describe verified Apple-platform work as `HIG-aligned`, with coverage limits; do not promise total compliance.
- Describe Web, Android, and generic cross-platform output as `Apple-inspired`, never HIG-compliant.
- Share domain logic, content models, and brand tokens. Adapt navigation, windows, commands, density, input, materials, and accessibility semantics to each host platform.
- Prefer standard controls and semantic values. Customize only when the product value exceeds losses in familiarity, accessibility, and OS adaptation.
- Express branding through content, composition, imagery, and restrained styling before replacing platform behavior.

## Respect artifact limits

- A screenshot can establish visible hierarchy, density, typography, color, apparent targets, and one state; physical hit-region sizes require scale and runtime evidence. It cannot establish motion, focus or reading order, Dynamic Type, VoiceOver, or end-to-end behavior.
- Source code can establish implementation choices and reachable paths, but not final rendering or assistive-technology output without execution.
- A build, static scan, simulator screenshot, or single device never establishes ship readiness by itself.
- Score only verified dimensions and disclose the denominator. Any Critical finding makes the result `not ship-ready` regardless of arithmetic score.

## Protect rights and integrity

- Link to Apple primary material; do not bundle a copied or distilled HIG corpus.
- Keep repository code licenses separate from rights in Apple text and assets.
- Check the applicable license before distributing Apple Design Resources, fonts, SF Symbols exports, templates, imagery, or third-party text.
- Do not sacrifice clarity, accessibility, performance, or platform behavior for Liquid Glass, translucency, blur, or animation.

## Deliver the result

For design or implementation, provide the design contract, platform decisions, source ledger, changes, verification, and remaining limits.

For review or audit, order findings by severity. Include `Finding`, `Severity`, `Evidence`, `Source`, `Impact`, `Fix`, and `Verify`. Separate confirmed issues, contextual judgments, false positives, and unverified areas. Place citations beside the claims they support.
